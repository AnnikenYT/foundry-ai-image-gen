# AI Image Generation inside of Foundry
Look, I hate AI Images just as much as the next guy. But matter of fact; its convenient. And while I love spending hours making scenes for my D&D Sessions,
there are Situations where getting a quick Theatre-Of-The-Mind image that shows exactly what you're describing right now to wow the players in the middle of exploring is great.
AI Image Generation Inside FoundryVTT - Because if you can't beat em...

## Concept

This Plugin is primarily for generating images during a session. Your players move somewhere you didn't expect? Type in a prompt, and get a nice theatre of the mind map made in 30 seconds.
Sure, they might not be perfect, but its definitely gonna give your players the feeling as if you prepared way more then you probably did in the 30 minutes before the session :P.
